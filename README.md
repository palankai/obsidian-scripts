# obsidian-scripts

This is a collection of handy scripts for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Scripts

### youtube-sync

It makes notes for every playlist element in a YouTube playlist.
I use this to create notes for the youtube videos I found useful.




## Installation, dependencies, etc

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run bin/youtube_sync.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.18. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
